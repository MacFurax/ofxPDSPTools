# WIP ofxPDSPTools

**`Work in progress`**    

High level modules and tools to use with [ofxPDSP](https://github.com/npisanti/ofxPDSP). Like Synth, Synth parameters, patch saving/loading, UI helpers ... 

Not sure of everything yet, code can change at any moment.

Project started to understand Software Synthetises, reshape in C++ and explore OF.
