# WIP ofxPDSPTools

**Work in progress**    

High level modules and tools to use with [ofxPDSP](https://github.com/npisanti/ofxPDSP). Like Synth, Synth parameters, patch saving/loading, UI helpers ... 

Not sure of everything yet, code can change at any moment.

Substractive synth with few different type of voices

# Synth Params & Patchs

Use ofxParameter and ofPrarameterGroup to allow easy patch save/load and pathing to pdsp::Patchable.
